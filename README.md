# MovieLensCapstone
edx Capstone for MovieLens Dataset
The files contained in this project were created for a Final Capstone assignment for the edx Data Science Certificate course.

The RMD file is used to generate the report in PDF format using the knit utility.
The R file was extracted from the RMD file by executing the following command:
knitr::purl("MovieLens_Project.rmd",documentation = 2)

The generated R file was adjusted for readability, any indentation needs as well as the original code provided by the University to generate the edx and validation sets.

Data Science is an evolving field and one can never say that he/she has known it all. My work here is based on learning from the edx course, additional online reading from Udemy courses, 
as well as reviewing several other developers' work to understand the different startegies of data analysis.

Some day, I would love to develop this from scratch in Python, which I believe has more optimized libraries and a more comprehensive eco system for the field of Machine Learning.

Thank you for checking out my work.
